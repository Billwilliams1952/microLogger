# Format is
# Tooltip ID number - DO NOT CHANGE! : Tooltip text to display $
#
# Blank lines are ignored, and any line starting with a '#' is ignored.
# All whitespace before and after the Tooltip ID Number and text is removed before processing.
# Text will continue to be appended until the line ends with a dollar sign.
# The '(C)' text is replaced with:
#	'Thanks to: picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/api_camera.html'
#e.g.,
# 35 : This is some tooltip text. $
# 36 : This text here spans three lines. The amount of text is only limited by python
#      and could be huge. This can go on until a the dollar sign is 
#      found. $
# 36 : The next tooltip. Use a newline \n to force a newline in the displayed text. $

# ----------------------- TODOs ------------------------
# ADD: An optional aspect number to control the size of the tooltip 
# ADD: Common text. Embed in text by <Number>
#      e.g.
#	 300 : This is some text.\n\nNow add common text here. <25000> $
#      25000 : This is special text that may be referenced multiple times. $
